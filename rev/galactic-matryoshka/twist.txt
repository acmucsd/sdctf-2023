Use 64-bit ints instead of 128 for convenience probably

Have a marker in a binary



UNIQUE_MARKER
[x]
[r]
[y]

Every iteration do:
r' <-$- Z_p # Use /dev/urandom or getrandom() syscall
x <- x * c * r' mod p
r <- r * r'
y <- y + 1

At the end (when y = y_0), make sure x * r^{-1} is the flag


Spec:

The nth doll have the name doll-n and will print:

Extracted the next doll to doll-{n+1}. You will find the flag in the innermost doll.
Good luck!

OR

Congrats! You found the innermost doll and found this written on it:
FLAG

Test for bugs in Big-integer systems and printing, or use some built-in like __int128
